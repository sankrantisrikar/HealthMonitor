**HealthMonitor:** Real-Time Patient Vital Monitoring System on Google Cloud
HealthMonitor is a real-time patient vital-sign monitoring system built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It simulates live patient data (right now we’re generating our own “live” data with some beautiful inconsistencies 😅 but it really works with real sensor data if you feed it).

The vitals are streamed into Pub/Sub, processed through a Dataflow (Apache Beam) streaming pipeline that computes risk scores and status labels, and stored in BigQuery for real-time alerting, analytics, and ICU-style dashboards.

# 🔍 Component Breakdown

## **1️⃣ Synthetic Vital Generator (Python)**  
A Python script generates periodic vital-sign readings for multiple patients.

It produces realistic values for:

- Heart rate  
- Oxygen saturation (SpO₂)  
- Temperature  
- Respiratory rate  
- Timestamp  

This data includes natural randomness — and occasionally amusing inconsistencies 😅 — to mimic real-world sensor noise.

Each reading is formatted as JSON and published to **Pub/Sub**.

---

## **2️⃣ Pub/Sub (Ingestion Layer)**  
Pub/Sub acts as the real-time message ingestion system.

It provides:

- Scalable message delivery  
- Low latency  
- Guaranteed ordering (per publisher)  
- Ability to connect multiple downstream consumers  

---

## **3️⃣ Dataflow (Apache Beam) Streaming Pipeline**  
The core processing engine of HealthMonitor.

The pipeline:

- ✔ Reads messages from Pub/Sub  
- ✔ Parses and validates JSON  
- ✔ Computes a **risk score**  
- ✔ Assigns a status label:  
  - **STABLE**  
  - **ELEVATED**  
  - **CRITICAL**  
- ✔ Writes enriched records to **BigQuery**  

This enables continuous real-time monitoring of patient vitals.

## **4️⃣ BigQuery (Analytical Storage)**  
A central dataset stores curated, structured patient vital data.

### **Schema Example**

| Column        | Type       |
|---------------|------------|
| patient_id    | INTEGER    |
| heart_rate    | FLOAT      |
| spo2          | FLOAT      |
| temperature   | FLOAT      |
| resp_rate     | FLOAT      |
| risk_score    | INTEGER    |
| status        | STRING     |
| ts            | TIMESTAMP  |
| ingest_ts     | TIMESTAMP  |

Use BigQuery for:

- Identifying high-risk patients  
- Tracking health trends  
- Reviewing ICU events  

---

## **5️⃣ Dashboard Layer (Power BI)**  
Connect BigQuery to Power BI to build a real-time ICU dashboard with:

- Heart-rate trends  
- SpO₂ changes  
- Temperature spikes  
- Critical condition alerts  
- Live patient monitoring panels
